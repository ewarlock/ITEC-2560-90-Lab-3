            <p class="text-justify p-4 content-area">For my C# final last semester I created a program to help keep track
                of different effects (such as spells or conditions) that come up during
                 combat when I am running Dungeons and Dragons for my friends. 
                <br><br>
                It can be very difficult to keep track of all of the effects 
                that crop up during combat, as they all have varying durations and 
                are enacted by the players and monsters at different times. It can also 
                difficult to keep track of the turn order (referred to as Initiative.)
                <br><br>
                I created this program to allow the user to enter the number everyone 
                rolls for their Initiative score or turn order. The program then cycles 
                through all of the players' turns based on this turn order, and displays 
                the name of whoever's turn it is at the top.
                <br><br>           
                The program also stores different effects and their durations in a database. 
                Effects can then be applied to a combat session, and the duration counter 
                will automatically count down as the user cycles through turns. Effects 
                that have expired (when the duration counter reaches 0) are automatically removed.
                <br><br>
                I had a lot of fun working on this program and have already started to use 
                it when I run Dungeons and Dragons. I'm planning on working on it more during 
                spring break and over the summer!
